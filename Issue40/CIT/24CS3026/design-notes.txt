This design captures the literal essence of effervescence through the use of negative space bubbles rising upward, visually symbolizing the bubbling energy, high spirits, and limitless potential of youth. The solid circular foundation anchors the logo, representing the unity and strength of the festival community, while the floating elements imply dynamic motion and the release of creative ideas. Its clean, geometric simplicity ensures the symbol remains timeless and versatile, maintaining perfect legibility across all mediums, from small mobile screens to large-scale merchandise. By deliberately avoiding specific cultural props, the design establishes a universal identity that stands for pure celebration and vivacity.
